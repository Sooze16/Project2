# HORUS: Keeping An Eye On Your Home

Horus is a sensor-based home monitoring application. It provides the user with real-time monitoring utilizing various inputs from your home through remote senors, eg water, gas, motion, temperature. In the event that a sensnor is triggered, an API is utilized to notify the registered user. From the dashboard application, the user can check the status, test, or reset the sensors. Additionally, a weather feed is provided to the user for predictive action at their discretion.
